# 10.21449/ijate.730481 (Measurement Invariance)

This repository contains R code used in both my master's thesis and my first article. In these studies, I first conducted confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the complete dataset (no missing data, no outliers), followed by measurement invariance analyses across gender and statistical region groups. The scripts in this repository include the exact code used to perform these analyses.
